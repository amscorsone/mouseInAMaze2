 *move randomly until you see the cheese no matter how far away
make list of all empty neighbors and if there is nothing in the way, meaning 
all of the spaces in between the cheese and mouse are empty the mouse will teleport to the
cheese, this means you start with dumb mouse code and then implemnet something to 
notice when the cheese is within the direct path and then use the teleport mouse code
